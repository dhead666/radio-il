ILRadio: A M3U Playlist for Israeli Radio Stations
---------------------------------------------------

This playlist is intended to be used with IPTVSimple PVR-addon for XBMC by afedchin.

Just download as zip, extract somewhere, choose the m3u and icons library.

Instead of using a local m3u, one can configured to use the link for constantly updating m3u on github.
For the playlist in Hebrew: http://git.io/sGTnZA
For the playlist in English: http://git.io/XUJzaQ

Issues:
1. Currently the a local copy of the stations' icons need to be kept.
2. IPTVSimple doesn't support radio stations so these appears as tv channels.
3. IPTVSimple doesn't support asx & asp so the mms strams need to be extracted 
   and some of those radio stations are rotating and cutting their stream between few mms.
4. No epg is available currently.


I'm a bit new to git and vcs but I'm always happy to get PR's,
logos and new stations' stream url are welcome.

All the rights on the logos belongs to their creators and the stations,
I've not created these images, they're only included here for the benefit of the users and not for misuse.
if you're the rightfull owner of one or more of these logos you're welcome to open an issue or to send a mail in the matter for myfoolishgames-at-gmaildotcom
