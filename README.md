Radio-IL: A M3U Playlist for Israeli Radio Stations
---------------------------------------------------

This playlist is intended to be used with IPTVSimple PVR-addon for XBMC by afedchin but will work with any player which support m3u playlist.

Just download as zip, extract somewhere, choose the m3u and the logos library.


Issues:  
1. Currently a local copy of the stations' logos need to be kept.  
2. IPTVSimple v0.1.3+ needed for supporting the radio tag, on older version the stations will appear as tv channels.  
3. IPTVSimple doesn't support asx/asp so the streams links need to be extracted,  
   if the asx/asp contains a stream playlist and an auto rotation between the stream needed then the transmission may cut off.  
4. No epg is available currently.  
5. Online list won't update over https only over http (GitHub links are unusable).  

To Do:  
1. Updating the logos, larger logos and better quality, logos with transparent background and with white background.  
2. Adding all iba radio stations.  

I'm a bit new to git and vcs but I'm always happy to get PR's,  
logos and new stations' stream url are welcome.  


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

All the rights on the logos belongs to their creators and the stations,  
I've not created these images, they're only included here for the benefit of the users and not for misuse.  
if you're the rightfull owner of one or more of these logos you're welcome to open an issue or to send a mail in the matter for myfoolishgames-at-gmaildotcom
